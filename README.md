# RetailSync AI: Predictive Sales Dashboard with ML & LLM Insights

![RetailSync AI Dashboard](screenshots/dashboard.png)

RetailSync AI is a cutting-edge data science project that forecasts retail sales and delivers actionable business intelligence (BI) using a Kaggle dataset (100k records, India stores, 2019-2023). Built with Python, it combines **machine learning (ML)** models and **large language model (LLM)**-powered queries to empower retail decision-making. The project features exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, ARIMA, LSTM), and a dynamic Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions and insights.

This repository showcases end-to-end skills—data preprocessing, feature engineering, ML pipelines, and interactive deployment—perfect for retail analytics innovation. A huge **thank you** to Abu Humza Khan for the Kaggle dataset ([Store Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abuhumzakhan/store-data)), which fueled this project!

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Cleans and preprocesses retail sales data.
  - Engineers features like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Discount Impact.
  - Visualizes trends, customer segments, and discount-profit correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Trains Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest (R² ~0.5–0.7), ARIMA, and LSTM (R² ~0.7).
  - Evaluates with MSE, R², and visualizes feature importance and forecasts.
- **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**:
  - **ML Predictions**: Sliders for Quantity, Discount, and more to forecast sales.
  - **BI Insights**: LLM-powered queries (Mistral-7B via OpenRouter) like “Top 5 sales in East.”
  - **Visualizations**: Dynamic Altair charts for top metrics and predictions.
- **Deployment**: Runs locally or via Google Colab with Ngrok for public access.
